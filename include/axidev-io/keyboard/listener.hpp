/**
 * @file keyboard/listener.hpp
 * @brief Global keyboard event Listener (cross-platform).
 *
 * The Listener provides a cross-platform, best-effort global keyboard event
 * monitoring facility. It invokes a user-supplied callback for each observed
 * key event with a computed Unicode codepoint (0 if none), the logical Key,
 * the active Modifier bitmask, and whether the event is a press (true) or
 * a release (false).
 *
 * Note on timing and character delivery:
 * - Users are encouraged to use the logical `key` and `mods` (modifiers) for
 *   most use cases as they are more reliable and portable. The `codepoint`
 *   is provided as additional context but is often not needed.
 * - The delivered `codepoint` is computed from raw key events and represents
 *   the Unicode character produced at the time of that low-level event. On
 *   some platforms (notably Windows low-level hooks) the character computed
 *   for a key press may differ from the character observed by the focused
 *   application or terminal (which commonly receives the character on key
 *   release). This can produce mismatches if consumers only observe press
 *   events.
 * - Consumers that want to reliably capture the characters visible to the
 *   focused application or terminal/STDIN should consider handling characters
 *   on key release (when `pressed == false`). The Listener provides both press
 *   and release events so callers can choose the behaviour that best fits
 *   their needs.
 * - The codepoint mapping is intentionally lightweight and does not implement
 *   full IME / dead-key composition; it is a best-effort mapping for common
 *   printable characters.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include <axidev-io/keyboard/listener.hpp>
 *
 * int main() {
 *   axidev::io::keyboard::Listener l;
 *   bool ok = l.start([](char32_t _cp, axidev::io::keyboard::Key k,
 *                        axidev::io::keyboard::Modifier m, bool pressed) {
 *     // Use k and m for most logic; codepoint is often unnecessary.
 *   });
 *   if (!ok) {
 *     // Listener couldn't be started (missing permissions/platform support)
 *   }
 *   // ...
 *   l.stop();
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
